version 1.0
## 
## This WDL combines splice analysis results for many tissue samples into
## a single dictionary of splices with a vector of counts.
##
## Requirements/expectations :
## - Directory with results from splicer analysis of RNASeq data
##
## Outputs:
## - A .zip files with combined results.  Dictionary of splices with a vector of counts for each sample.
